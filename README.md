# Wonder Library DB Design

Wonder Library is a library for all ages. Wonder Library would like one relational database to be able to smoothly carry out their work in an organized way. 
This project required me to design the database and the final result is 20 Tables, 5 Views and 1 Trigger (This was for fun)

# Technology Used
1. MySQL
2. MIRO (For EER diagram)

# Steps
This project was carried out in 3 phases,
1. `Phase 1`: This was the phase were the requirements of the Wonder library was captured and understood. From this requirement I build an EER diagram.
2. `Phase 2`: Created a relational schema from the EER diagram ensuring that the tables were in 3NF.
3. `Phase 3`: Finally, created tables and views following the relational schema diagram.

# How to read this project?
1. Go through the "Wonder Library Requirements" document to understand the requirements and details about Phase 1,2 and 3.
2. Read the "Implementation Report" to see the implementations. (The EER diagram was done in MIRO website, it's link is in this doc)
